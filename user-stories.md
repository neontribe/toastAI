# Considerations

* Profile selection allows for the one to select other's preferences
* Potential timer to postpone timing
* Review and evaluation recommended, not forced, to help those with time constraints
* Independent learning for different food types, with easy selection
* Big, easy-to-use simply interface
* Show common orders and take into account other considerations for fast usage (ideally no more than one screen of configuration)
